# TimescaleDB Finance

Welcome to the TimescaleDB Finance repository! This project is dedicated to providing tools and workflows for effectively processing financial data using TimescaleDB.

## What is TimescaleDB?

TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data. It's optimized for fast ingest and complex queries, making it ideal for finance, IoT, DevOps, and other time-series data applications.

## Features

This repository provides:

- A `ticks` hypertable for efficient storage and querying of tick data.
- Continuous aggregates for generating candlesticks.
- Utilities for tracking symbol pairs and last prices.

## Common Use Cases

This setup is ideal for anyone working with financial time-series data in TimescaleDB, such as:

- Financial analysts tracking market trends.
- Data scientists conducting financial research.
- Fintech applications requiring real-time market data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need to have TimescaleDB installed. If you haven't already, you can find detailed installation instructions on the [Timescale installation pages](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/installation).

### Setup and Usage

Once TimescaleDB is installed, follow these steps to set up and use the repository:
1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Run the provided SQL files in your TimescaleDB instance to set up the database schema.

The [main.sql](./main.sql)  load all features in the order, or you can choose to load:

* [ticks.sql](./ticks.sql) setup the `ticks` hypertable with compression settings
 and add continuous aggregates and utility view to track `ohlcv_1m` and `ohlcv_1h`.

* [track_last_symbol_price](./track_last_symbol_price.sql) will track `last`
 `last_price` on `symbols` table too.

* [pairs.sql](./pairs.sql) allows you to `track_pairs` of trades and pipe it
    `ticks` back to `ticks` table.

* [cleanup.sql](./cleanup.sql) will remove all structures from the DB.
